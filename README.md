## Running MoE models that do not fit in RAM

In a Mixture-of-Experts model most of the weights are routed experts, and each token
uses only a few of them. GLM-5.3-Flash, for example, is 320B parameters, but 304B of
those are experts and a token touches 8 of the 288 experts in each of 42 layers. Stock
llama.cpp still has to hold every expert in memory (or let `mmap` page them through the
file cache, which is slow and uncontrolled).

With `--moe-stream`, the routed-expert tensors are never loaded. Each layer gets a cache
of expert *slots* on the compute device; after the router picks the experts for a token,
missing ones are read from the GGUF file by a pool of I/O threads and evicted by a
decaying hotness score. Routing decisions are unchanged, so output is bit-identical to a
fully resident run. Only latency changes. Everything that is not a routed expert
(attention, routers, shared experts, embeddings, output head, KV cache) stays resident
as usual, so that is the memory floor.

### Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--moe-stream` | enable expert streaming |
| `--moe-stream-cache <N\|Ns>` | cache budget in GiB (`40`), or exact slots per layer (`64s`); implies `--moe-stream` |
| `--moe-stream-direct` | bypass the OS page cache (O_DIRECT on Linux, F_NOCACHE on macOS); use when the model far exceeds RAM, or to benchmark a smaller machine honestly |
| `--moe-stream-io-threads N` | reader threads (default: auto) |
| `--moe-stream-ram N` | pinned host mirror in GiB for discrete GPUs; set `0` on unified-memory machines such as Apple Silicon |
| `LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_DYN=N` (env) | size of the hotness-ranked pool. Slots beyond it are pinned by expert ID; set it equal to the slot count to make the whole cache hotness-ranked, which measured better |

The dynamic pool must hold at least `3 * n_expert_used` slots (24 for an 8-expert
model) for chunked prefill, so use at least that many slots.

### Expert pack: one read per expert

In a GGUF the gate, up and down tensors of a layer are stored separately, so a cache miss
is three reads at three file offsets. `scripts/moe_expert_pack.py <first-shard.gguf>` writes
`<first-shard.gguf>.epack`, one page-aligned blob per (layer, expert) with all of its slabs
together; the runtime picks it up automatically and loads a miss with a single `preadv`
straight into the cache slot (`LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_PACK=<path>` overrides the location). The
pack is a second copy of the expert weights on disk, built in a few minutes.

Measured on GLM-5.3-Flash IQ4_XS, 200 slots, M5 Max: 9.9 -> 11.2 tok/s buffered and
10.1 -> 12.5 tok/s with `--moe-stream-direct`. On a smaller cache where decode is fully
SSD-bound the gain is larger (Qwen3.5-35B-A3B Q8, 24 slots, uncached: 6.6 -> 10.4 tok/s).
Output is identical with and without the pack.

On unified-memory Macs the runtime also fills cache slots by reading directly into the
Metal shared buffer rather than through a staging copy (`LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_NO_DIRECT_WRITE=1`
disables it).

### Example: GLM-5.3-Flash on a Mac

```sh
LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_DYN=24 llama-server \
    -m GLM-5.3-Flash-UD-IQ4_XS-00001-of-00005.gguf \
    --moe-stream-cache 24s --moe-stream-ram 0 --moe-stream-direct -c 8192
```

Measured on an M5 Max with the 157 GB `UD-IQ4_XS` GGUF, 480-token prompt, 256
generated tokens, `temp 0`, Metal, page cache bypassed except where noted:

| Slots per layer | Expert cache | Peak footprint | Hit rate | Prefill | Decode | Fits a |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 24 (buffered) | 11.4 GB | 22.8 GB | 50% | 24.5 tok/s | 3.1 tok/s | 32 GB Mac |
| 24 | 11.4 GB | 22.7 GB | 50% | 26.2 tok/s | 2.7 tok/s | 32 GB Mac |
| 48 | 22.8 GB | 34.8 GB | 62% | 35.2 tok/s | 3.7 tok/s | 48 GB Mac |
| 96 | 45.7 GB | 58.8 GB | 76% | 44.4 tok/s | 4.9 tok/s | 64 GB Mac |
| 160 | 76.1 GB | 90.1 GB | 85% | 45.2 tok/s | 7.5 tok/s | 128 GB Mac |
| 200 | 97.5 GB | ~107 GB | 89.5% | 46 tok/s | 9.65 tok/s, 12.5 with the expert pack and `--moe-stream-direct` | 128 GB Mac, ceiling |

The resident part was 9 GB (core weights) plus about 0.5 GB of KV and compute buffers at
8K context. All five runs produced identical text. Decode is bound by SSD bandwidth
times miss rate: roughly 6 GB/s from the internal SSD here, with 14 MB per expert read.

### Sizing a cache

1. Find the model's fixed cost: load once with a small cache and read the
   `model buffer size`, `KV buffer size` and `compute buffer size` lines (run with `-lv 4`).
2. Subtract that and about 4 GB for the OS from your RAM; the rest is the expert cache.
3. Slot size is bytes per expert at your quantization; the loader prints
   `expert cache size = ... (N slots per layer)` so you can check the arithmetic.
4. More slots raise the hit rate roughly with the logarithm of cache size. Pass
   `--moe-stream-direct` when the model is much larger than RAM, otherwise leave it off
   and let the page cache help.

Higher-precision quantizations cost more per slot and per miss but nothing extra on
disk, so streaming lets a quality-first setup keep experts at 6- or 8-bit at the price
of tokens per second rather than of RAM.

### Notes

- Works for any MoE architecture, since it operates on the generic `ffn_*_exps` tensors.
  Dense models are unaffected by the flags.
- `glm5next` GGUFs (converted with Unsloth's pre-merge PR) load as `glm5-next` on this
  branch.
- One context per streamed model: concurrent decodes on the same model can evict each
  other's experts.
- Upstream tracking: this is [PR #25294](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/25294)
  and [ServeurpersoCom's partition rebase](https://github.com/ServeurpersoCom/llama.cpp/tree/moe-stream-partition),
  rebased onto master with macOS fixes.

## Description

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM (and VLM) inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on
a wide range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)
- Vulkan and SYCL backend support
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

The `llama.cpp` project is build on top of the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.
